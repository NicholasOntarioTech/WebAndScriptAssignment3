CSS file is my own creation, no outside source was used.

Numerous parts of this website were created with bootstrap, these include
- Header nav bar 
- Footer
- Home screen comment cards
- Gigs diplay table
- Add / Edit gigs form

Fontawesome was also used, exclusively for the guitar icon next to the gigs tabs in the header nav bar

NOTE ON LOGO:
The 'i' in the logo contains a banjo, and that banjo is NOT OF MY OWN DESIGN! That being said, the icon
is free to use. Here is the source: https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/18163/banjo
